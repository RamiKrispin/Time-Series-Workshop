## Introduction to time series analysis and forecasting

### Time series data

> **Time series data** - is a sequence of values, each associate to a unique point in time

> **Regular time series** - is a sequence of observations which were captured at equally spaced time intervals (e.g., every month, week, day, hour, etc.)

> **Irregular time series** - or unevenly spaced time series, is a sequence of observations which were not captured on equally spaced time intervals (for example rainy days, earthquakes, etc.)



**Note:** typically, the term time series data referred to regular time-series data.

### Examples of time series data

```{r echo = TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(UKgrid)

data(UKgrid)
UKgrid <- extract_grid(type = "data.frame", start = as.Date("2018-01-01"), end = as.Date("2018-01-31"))
TSstudio::ts_plot(UKgrid, title = "The Demand for Electricity in the UK (Half-Hourly Intervals)", Ytitle = "MW", Xtitle = "Date")

library(TSstudio)


TSstudio::ts_plot(USgas, title = "US Monthly Natural Gas Consumption", Ytitle = "Billion Cubic Feet", Xtitle = "Date")
TSstudio::ts_plot(USVSales, title = "US Monthly Total Vehicle Sales", Ytitle = "Thousands of Units", Xtitle = "Date")



```


### Time Series Analysis
> **Time series analysis** - is the process of extracting meaningful insights from time series data in order to learn about the past and predict the future
